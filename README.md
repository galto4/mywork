### Overview (Introduction)

This repository contains my analysis of the famous Palmer Penguins dataset.

The data set is available [on GitHub](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) and contains size measurements for three species of penguins, that were observed across three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antartica.

The data was collected by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://gormankb.github.io/) between 2007-2009 with the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research Program [LTER](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/).

## Approach to Analysis

The analysis of the Palmer Penguin dataset was broken down into the following parts:

- <b>Import Libraries</b>: All important libraries (Pandas, NumPy, MatPlotLib) were loaded to to facilitate thorough investigation of the dataset.
- <b>Load the Data</b>: The 'Palmer Penguins' data was then loaded into my notebook, and validate
- <b>Inspect the Data</b>: The data was reviewed to check for data types and structure, missing cells, unique values, etc. 
- <b>Data Variables</b>: A light review of the variable types to assess what type of analysis could be performed.
- <b>Data Visualisation</b>: Using Histogram and Bar Charts to analyse and illustrate the dataset.
-<b>Correlation Analysis</b>: Analysis of how correlated data variables are across the dataset.
