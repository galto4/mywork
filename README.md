### About this Project (Introduction)

This repository contains my analysis of the famous Palmer Penguins dataset.

The data set is available [on GitHub](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) and contains size measurements for three species of penguins, that were observed across three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antartica.

The data was collected by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://gormankb.github.io/) between 2007-2009 with the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research Program [LTER](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/).
